App Structure
*************

Class dependencies
	GoalListApp(GoalListAppManager) -> Goal -> DynamicArray
	
Class Descriptions
	GoalListApp:
		-main program resides here.  
		-contains a goal list manager subclass to manage goals list 
		-controls the flow of the program, interacting directly with
		the user to allow them to add, delete, edit, display etc. the goals they 
		have created.
		
		private class GoalListManager
			description-
				Manages a DynamicArray of goal and its subgoals.
			members-
				DynamicArray<Goal> goals - DynamicArray of Goal to hold the main goals created by the user, all other goals are direct or indirect subgoals of these top level goals
			methods-
				public swapSiblings(Goal sibling1, Goal sibling2) - causes one sibling(goals directly under the same parent goal) goal to swap positions in ordering with another
				printGoals() - display all goals that should be showing (all parent goals expanded where appropriate)
	Goal:
		description- 
			Represents one goal and contains an array of Goal to serve as subgoals to this goal, which can in turn also have their own subgoals
		members-
			private String path - a String containing a sequence of DyanamicArray indices divided by ".".  Allows the location of a specific goal.
			String goalName - String representing the name of the goal created by the user
			DynamicArray<Goal> subgoals - array of Goal to contain subgoals
			boolean expanded - indicates whether this goal should be showing it subgoals
		methods-
			public Goal[] getSubGoals() - return an array of Goal containing all subgoals of this goal
			public contractGoal() - set expanded to false
			public expandGoal() - set expanded to true
		
	DynamicArray:
		description - 
			Parameterized class designed to allow the creation of dyanamic arrays 
			of any type.  Increases the size of the array whenever an attempt is made to access an index that is currently out of bounds.  
			Increases the size of the array to double the size of the desired index.

Challenges
- need to be able to link goals as they appear to the user with goals as they exist
in DynamicArray of Goal
