-Added method private Path convertToPath(String pathString) throws NumberFormatException
to GoalListManager class for converting path Strings to Path objects.This was necessary 
to enable the user to specify a path as a String.  Now the user will not need to 
have access to the GoalListManager inner class Path.
-Changed method public static Path getPath(Goal goal) to public static String 
getPath(Goal goal) GoalListManager inner class Goal.This was done to avoid sending 
a Path object back to client application.
-Added method public int getPathSize(String pathString) to GoalListManager class.
This is necessary for the client to be able to access the size of a path without
having direct access to the Path object.
-Changed several methods that once required a Path object as an argument to now take
a String argument representing the path.
-Deleted method private DynamicArrayList<Goal> getDirectSubGoals() in inner class 
Goal cus it was useless.
